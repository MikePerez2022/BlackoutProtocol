# Blackout Protocol

**Blackout Protocol** is a horror shooter prototype where survival depends on light, sound, and resource management. You must escape an underground facility with almost no visibility, using only a fragile flashlight and a gun—both powered by the same battery.

## 📌 What the Project Is

This project was developed as a **foundation prototype** in **Unreal Engine 5**. It demonstrates advanced gameplay systems focused on:

* Dual-drain resource mechanics (ammo and flashlight).
* AI perception driven by sound.
* Atmospheric level design and tension through visibility limitations.
* Survival-oriented gameplay loop.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

* **Darkness as the Enemy** – The facility is nearly pitch-black. Your flashlight is your lifeline.
* **Dual Drain Mechanic** – Every bullet you fire and every second of flashlight use drains the same shared battery.
* **Sound-Driven Enemies** – Creatures stalk you by listening. Gunfire, footsteps, or even careless noise can reveal your position.
* **Resource Management** – Scavenge for battery packs and health supplies to push deeper.
* **Escape Objective** – Navigate the oppressive facility, survive encounters, and find your way out.
